# Aim1-SecondaryAnalyses
Specific Aim 1. Identify predictors of antibiotic overuse to help form equivalent study groups (for the
randomized trial in Aim 2) and identify treatment moderators (for Aim 3).

A. Conduct a multivariate analysis to identify variations in antibiotic prescribing and patient satisfaction at qualifying visits. Identify provider-level factors (e.g. geographic region) that predict antibiotic prescribing
and prepare relevant questions for persons in these subgroups for interviews.

B. Complete structured interviews with up to 5 providers in each performance subgroup and up to 5 providers
in each predictor subgroup so that providers with representative, better, and worse than expected performance are identified. Identify attitudes and behaviors, particularly with respect to social and professional norms.

C. Develop randomization and stratification blocks for the trial and refine subgroup hypotheses and
intervention design.
